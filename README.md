Inventory Management Dashboard built with Excel and Power BI. Analyzes stock value, SKU turnover, ABC classification, reorder points, and demand patterns for 300+ SKUs.

This project presents an interactive Inventory Management Dashboard built using Excel and Power BI, designed to support Warehouse and In-Plant Inventory Managers in monitoring inventory levels, optimizing reorder points, and ensuring consistent service levels.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Power BI (Data modeling, DAX, visualization)

Microsoft Excel (Raw data source)

📊 Key Analytical Components
ABC Classification – Segregates SKUs by annual revenue (High, Medium, Low value)

XYZ Classification – Categorizes SKUs by demand variability (Uniform, Variable, Uncertain)

Inventory Turnover Ratio – Tracks how efficiently stock is cycled

Safety Stock Calculation – Helps maintain service levels during demand fluctuations

Reorder Point Estimation – Predicts when stock needs to be replenished

Weekly Demand Calculation – Uses historical data for trend analysis

Stock Status Overview – Real-time stock conditions (In Stock, Below Safety, Out of Stock)

Forecasting – Projects stock needs for upcoming periods

📈 Visualizations Included
Stacked Area Chart – Shows cumulative and average values for ABC classification

Cards, Gauges, and Slicers – Display KPIs and filter by category

Tables, Matrix & Line Charts – Show distributions, trends, and turnover

Custom DAX Measures – Built using calculated columns and fields for insights

Time Intelligence – Combined dates and grouped weeks for reporting

🧩 Process Overview
Data Loading – Imported Excel dataset using Power BI’s Get Data feature

Data Cleaning & Transformation – Performed ETL steps in Power Query Editor

DAX Calculations – Created calculated fields for KPIs and logic

Interactive Dashboard Design – Developed visuals to reflect real-time inventory status

🔎 Note: A detailed PowerPoint presentation is attached with step-by-step instructions for building the dashboard.

✅ Conclusion
This Power BI dashboard helps inventory managers track stock health, minimize overstocking/understocking risks, and automate reordering based on historical demand patterns. It improves service levels by enabling timely and data-driven inventory decisions.
